/* CAUTION: Note that 
    - there is a difference between float/double positive and negative 0
    - primitive == does not distinguish between positive and negative zero
	that is, (+0.0 == -0.0) is true; use isPositiveZero and 
	isNegativeZero when you need to distinguish these
    - NaN compares false to everything: (NaN == NaN) is false; you have to
	use Double.isNaN(\...)
    - primitive == is not the same as .equals on Doubles
    - primitive comparisions (<, >, <=, >=) on doubles are not the same as
	.comparesTo on Doubles
